i worked project step by step ,from ETL process to create report and get insight


The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), which is a crucial step in data analysis. Here’s what each part of the ETL process means:

                           📍Extract Data:
                                This step involves taking data from various sources such as Excel, the web, and other data repositories.

                           📍Transform Data:
                                During this process, we standardize the data to make it more usable and consistent.

                                 Key objectives include:
                                          Making data analysis easier.
                                          Improving data quality.
                                          Preparing data for specific purposes.
                                          Standardizing data (since it comes from different sources with varying formats and structures).

                          📍Load Data:
                              In this step, we load the transformed data into tools like Power Apps or Power BI.


Common data errors that we encounter and need to address include:

1/ Missing values.

2/ Duplicate entries.

3/ Inconsistent formatting.

4/ Invalid data.

5/ Outliers.

6/ Data entry errors.



During my work, I encountered three cases:

         1️⃣ Cleaning Data:
                        I ensured data accuracy and consistency by addressing issues like missing values, incorrect data types, duplicates, and inconsistent 
                     formatting. This step is essential for producing accurate and reliable reports.

         2️⃣ Appending Data:
                        I combined data from another company to create insights for both companies in a single report.
                     This is useful when working with columns.

         3️⃣ Merging Data:
                        I merged data based on specific columns or criteria.
                        This is helpful when working with rows.

⚫All of these processes are typically executed using the Power Query Editor, which provides tools for data transformation and preparation.
