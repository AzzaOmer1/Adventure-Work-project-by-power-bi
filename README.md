i worked project step by step ,from ETL process to create report and get insight


The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), which is a crucial step in data analysis. Here’s what each part of the ETL process means:

                           📍Extract Data:
                                This step involves taking data from various sources such as Excel, the web, and other data repositories.

                           📍Transform Data:
                                During this process, we standardize the data to make it more usable and consistent.

                                 Key objectives include:
                                          Making data analysis easier.
                                          Improving data quality.
                                          Preparing data for specific purposes.
                                          Standardizing data (since it comes from different sources with varying formats and structures).

                          📍Load Data:
                              In this step, we load the transformed data into tools like Power Apps or Power BI.


Common data errors that we encounter and need to address include:
1/ Missing values.
2/ Duplicate entries.
3/ Inconsistent formatting.
4/ Invalid data.
5/ Outliers.
