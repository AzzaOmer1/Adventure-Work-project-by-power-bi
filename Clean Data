                                        ðŸ›’I get data and transform it in the Power Query Editor.Â 

                                        ðŸ”ƒReplaced null by 0 for the unit sold, sales price, sales, and profit columns.Â 

                                        ðŸš©Changed the type of manufacturing price column to a decimal.Â 

                                        ðŸ”ƒReplaced None value in Discount Band to 0. "0 represents no discount."Â 

                                        ðŸ”ƒReplaced text value in Unit Sold column to number (600) and change type of column to whole numberÂ 

                                        ðŸš«I found null values in the date column, when returned to the data source responsible.
                                        ðŸª„They knew that a null value appeared because there was a problem on that day (3/3/2023), ðŸ”ƒso replaced null values with 3/3/2023.Â 

                                        ðŸ§¹Remove DuplicateÂ .
