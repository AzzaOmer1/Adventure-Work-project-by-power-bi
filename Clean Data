🏢The company provided the two Excel files📑 containing 1️⃣ the Adventure Works sales data,
AdventureWorksSales.xlsx and 2️⃣ the new company’s data, OtherSales.xlsx. The datasets have some
common data such as
⚪ SalesOrderID, ⚪SalesOrderDetailID, ⚪UnitPrice and ⚪SalesDataas well as columns with different names.
📍 In tables that combined, the column
names that you want to stack vertically should be the same. For columns with matching names, their row
values are stacked vertically to merge them. 

📍while for columns that exist separately in each set, they will
be added horizontally, with null values for tables where those columns were not present before. To complete your task successfully you have to rename the common columns and give them the same
names.

📍 You also have to remove any unnecessary columns.


                                 The steps I followed :

                                        🛒I get data and transform it in the Power Query Editor. 

                                        🔃Replaced null by 0 for the unit sold, sales price, sales, and profit columns. 

                                        🚩Changed the type of manufacturing price column to a decimal. 

                                        🔃Replaced None value in Discount Band to 0. "0 represents no discount." 

                                        🔃Replaced text value in Unit Sold column to number (600) and change type of column to whole number 

                                        🚫I found null values in the date column, when returned to the data source responsible.
                                        🪄They knew that a null value appeared because there was a problem on that day (3/3/2023), 🔃so replaced null values with 3/3/2023. 

                                        🧹Remove Duplicate .
